# Multi-modal-Classification
This project implements a multi-modal classification system that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and Transformer-based architectures for text processing.

Key Features:
1) CNN-based Image Encoder: Processes images through a series of convolutional layers for robust feature extraction.
2) Transformer-based Text Encoder: Implements multi-head self-attention, masking, and sliding window mechanisms for efficient text representation.
3) Learnable Embedding Integration: Combines text and image embeddings using weighted parameters to enhance classification accuracy.
